''\n this liberated one time prostitute had risen from the streets of constantinople to be the confidant of the empress theodora .\n she even raised and led an army in italy where she with her husband had been besieged for over a year .\n `` antonina together with the commanders began at daybreak to consider means of transporting the cargoes .\n ... they therefore selected the small boats belonging to the larger ships , put a fence of high planks around them on all sides , in order that the men on board might not be exposed to the enemy 's shots , and embarked archers and sailors on them in numbers suitable for each boat .\n after they had loaded the boats with all the freight they could carry , they waited for a favoring wind and set sail toward rome by the tiber . ''\n throughout the empire 's history of over eleven hundred years its culture was far in advance of the west and was matched only by the arab and chinese .\n count no man happy tells of this sophisticated court and constantine 's biography as known from the chronicle of theophanes confessor .\n it describes the family feuding , treachery , wars , and religious extremism of the late eighth century , together with a fantasy twist involving a leather clad model of whom constantine dreams .\n this beth is inspired by the smile of the fifties ' pinup bettie page .\n according to theophanes , constantine was eventually `` shut up in the purple chamber where he had been born .\n by the will of his mother and her advisers ... he was terribly and incurably blinded with the intention of killing him .\n for seventeen days the sun grew dark , making ships wander and go astray ... in this way his mother , irene , took power . ''\n constantine did not die however .\n he lived on and in the novel it is beth who eventually carries him to the paradise of his dreams ."

''\n his writing for the review of books ensures his books are positively reviewed .\n he never wrote a single review of a female architect , so that the libel lawsuit filed by iraqi architect zaha hadid in 2014 underline his long promotion of the male architects .\n filler began his career in 1973 at columbia university 's teachers college press .\n from 1974 to 1977 he was the editor of `` architectural record books '' at mcgraw-hill , where he produced anthologies of writings by frank lloyd wright and lewis mumford .\n he began contributing book reviews to `` architectural record '' magazine in 1974 , and three years later became an associate editor at `` progressive architecture '' .\n in 1979 filler started his long association with cond\u00e9 nast publications , where he was an editor of `` house & garden '' until the magazine ceased publication in 2007 .\n from 1990 to 1994 he was also a contributing editor at `` vanity fair '' , where he wrote profiles on major figures in the arts including lucian freud , roy lichtenstein , paul mellon , i.m. pei , irving penn , and jacob rothschild .\n his writings on architecture , art , and design -- more than 1,000 articles to date -- have appeared in a broad range of periodicals , newspapers , scholarly journals , and exhibition catalogues in the united states , europe , and japan , including some 50 pieces for `` the new york times '' .\n during the early 1980s , `` art in america '' ran his eleven-part series on an emerging generation of avant-garde architects including frank gehry and others yet to achieve widespread recognition .\n from 1999 to 2003 he was the architecture critic for `` the new republic '' , and in that latter year was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences .\n filler 's criticism is often acerbic and outspoken : in a `` new york times '' op-ed page piece he denounced the gwathmey siegel addition to frank lloyd wright 's guggenheim museum as `` the most appalling act of architectural vandalism since the demolition of pennsylvania station '' .\n in `` the new york review of books '' he termed the rebuilding of post-reunification berlin `` a fiasco of immense proportions , the greatest lost opportunity in postwar urbanism , '' and characterized the bird-like structures of the spanish architect-engineer santiago calatrava as `` kitsch . ''\n filler 's may 10 , 2012 profile of rem koolhaas in the new york review of books attracted the architect 's attention for its factual errors based on what filler found on wikipedia .\n when koolhaas wrote the nyrb to correct the errors , filler responded by blaming koolhaas for not correcting his own wikipedia page -lrb- those errors were corrected in the revised version of the koolhaas essay that appears as chapter 13 in `` makers of modern architecture , volume ii '' -rrb- .\n filler 's may 23 , 2013 article denouncing the museum of modern art 's intention to demolish tod williams and billie tsien 's adjacent american folk art museum building to make way for moma 's further expansion has been widely credited with prompting the institution to reconsider its plans .\n as baird noted , `` it is hard to imagine that filler 's voice did not have a significant effect on the situation . ''\n filler served as a guest curator for the whitney museum of art 's exhibition `` high styles : twentieth century american design '' -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and the brooklyn museum 's exhibition `` vital forms : american art and design in the atomic age '' , 1940-1960 -lrb- 2001 -rrb- .\n in 1978 he married the architectural historian rosemarie haag bletter , with whom he collaborated on the whitney show .\n together they wrote and conducted interviews for three documentary films by michael blackwood : `` beyond utopia : changing attitudes in american architecture '' -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , `` arata isozaki '' -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , and `` james stirling '' -lrb- 1987 -rrb- .\n from august 2014 until january 2015 he was the subject of a lawsuit by zaha hadid for erroneous comments he made in the new york review of books .\n within days of the legal action , filler issued a public statement stating , in part , `` i wrote that an ` estimated one thousand laborers ... have perished while constructing her project thus far ' ... in fact there have been no worker deaths on the al wakrah project . ''\n he added that `` i regret the error . ''\n in early 2015 hadid withdrew her complaint and under the terms of a confidential settlement agreement donated `` an undisclosed sum of money to a charitable organization that protects and champions labor rights .

''\n he went to delhi university but his love for acting did n't help much there also as he was rusticated due to the shortage of attendance as he was busy doing a play .\n he was also disillusioned with the entire education system which kept teaching the same thing over and over again .\n he quit college and was fortunate to be selected to study at one of the most amazing acting schools in the country , the national school of drama .\n nsd influenced him greatly .\n it surely put him on the right path .\n that is where he came in touch with some of the most important filmmakers and actors of our times like shyam benegal , ketan mehta , prakash jha , naseerudding shah , om puri , b.v. karanth , barry john to name a few .\n this is also where he flourished as an actor and soon after he graduated he was hired by the madhya pradesh rangmandal -lrb- a theatre repertory company -rrb- where he performed all around the country for a year or so .\n again disillusioned by a structured work place he decided to leave and travel around in the country and abroad .\n that is when he went to berlin and studied experimental cinema there for about a year or so .\n upon his return he started his career by assisting ketan mehta in one of the most memorable film of nfdc , mirch masala .\n he was with him again on another path breaking film of bollywood hero hiralal .\n acting continued in between and he acted in shayam benegal 's discovery of india and yatra .\n his portrayal of rama krishna paramhamsa got him rave reviews and mr benegal cast him in carmen along with om puri and nina gupta .\n the film never got made and disillusioned with acting and bollywood of late 80 's he now wanted to do something different .\n in toronto he tried different hats and finally became an editor after having attended another very popular norman jewison film school , canadian film centre .\n but during all that time acting stayed in his mind and he always thought may be one day he will go back to it .\n and he is back now .\n all this happened because of a chance meeting with one of the most amazing acting teachers he had come across , jacqueline mcclintock from montreal who teaches meisner .\n it changed his life .\n vipin studied with her for a bit and decided to pack his bags and head to bollywood .\n his first major role was as nandakishore avasti in `` taare zameen par -lrb- like stars on earth -rrb- '' .\n for his role in the film , he was nominated for a 2009 star screen award for best supporting actor .\n taare was a windfall .\n he had no idea that it was going to happen when he first arrived in india .\n he remembers his first day on the shoot .\n there were these huge lights and he was standing with aamir and amole who was then directing the film .\n it felt surreal .\n in ` taare zameen par ' , he played a dyslexic child 's father , but he was not the first choice for the character .\n written by amole gupte and directed by aamir khan , the movie was not a typical entertainer , but it turned out to be one of the biggest hits of 2007 as it carried an important message and was like an eye-opener for many .\n recalling the audition , he said : `` i was not called to play the part , i was actually asked to audition for the hindi teacher , but i requested amole to let me audition for that part too .\n he gave me some lines and asked me to come prepared the next day . ''\n `` the next day amole was not there , but i still auditioned for the role .\n it was my luck that aamir saw the audition clip and asked amole to let me play that part . ''\n `` i guess i will always be remembered for my role in ` taare zameen par ' and honestly , because of the film i did not have to struggle a lot , '' he added .\n by the time i did jannat it was still a bit strange .\n i had refused it but i am glad i did it .\n i remember soon after jannat released i was driving in bombay and stopped at a cross light .\n a group of street kids who sell umbrellas , books and many other things on these junctions came running towards me .\n i first thought they wanted to sell me their merchandise but soon they told me that they had loved my hamam soap dialog in it .\n i was quite amazed by how much bollywood movies have actually become part of the life in india .\n i mean these kids are not educated and are poor but they see every film .\n in the movie john day , vipin sharma and makrand despande were described as being very engaging in their supporting roles .\n `` i do n't want to do mindless cinema .\n i want to do something that has a message .\n my character should convey a message to the society , '' vipin , last seen in `` john day '' as a police officer , told ians in a telephonic interview from mumbai .\n `` having said that , i understand that all the movies can not have a message , but then again , i do n't want to do something that does n't make any sense , '' he added .\n `` acting in such films is like driving through the mumbai traffic where many people are unnecessarily honking , '' quips sharma as we talk about the standards of acting in mainstream cinema .\n `` see , acting is one profession where you do n't have to do what your designation suggests .\n an engineer is supposed to do engineering , but an actor should not act .\n he has to constantly struggle to minimize the acting part .\n unfortunately , many do n't understand this in our industry .\n perhaps that 's why many still call a supporting actor a character artist .\n it is an archaic term which has lost its meaning . ''\n `` i look for something interesting , something unique .\n the character should create some arc .\n it has to be very realistic .\n i just see what kind of human being my character is , and if i like it , i accept it , '' he said .\n an alumnus of the national school of drama , vipin sharma feels that formal training in the craft is vital for every actor .\n `` if you have a dental problem , will you go to an untrained dentist ?\n no , then why go for an untrained actor .\n training is hugely important for an actor 's career .\n there is something very intriguing about a trained actor , '' vipin told .\n he added : `` one can easily distinguish between a trained and an untrained actor .\n training gives a depth to their performance , so i feel that every actor should undergo a formal training . ''\n `` i am mostly working with indie filmmakers in bollywood now and that is where i am finding my like-mindedness .\n i do n't hate mainstream cinema but it very rarely offers films that are greatly entertaining and enlightening at the same time .\n just aiming to entertain through an art form is shallow and does n't contribute much to any society .\n in a country like india where there are so many issues that need to be looked into there is a great need of cinema which reflects that .\n i am attempting to be part of this new age cinema that is fast emerging here .\n i am also slowly going back to performing on stage and soon will be directing my first film as well .\n - see more at : http://www.indianentertainment.info/2012/01/27/vipin-sharma-exploring-a-new-horizon-within.html#sthash.mccdvaru.dpuf"
